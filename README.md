# CMSE202_Final_Project
**Building a model to simulate how blood cells repopulate oxygen in the body**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code
- `Blood_Cell_Class.py` contains blood_cell class
- `General_O2_CO2_Class.py` contains oxygen_carbon_dioxide class
- `CMSE_202_Final_Project_Health_2.ipynb` contains all the code to run the model

## Contributions
- Jay Scott: most of the work in `General_O2_CO2_Class.py`, `simulation` function, docstrings, combined the code to run the model
- Raymod Smith: most of the work in `Blood_Cell_Class.py`, placed images on the `simulation`, docstrings, discussion, combined the code to run the model
- Chris Brown: `simulation` function, docstrings, combined the code to run the model
- Kewalin Samart: designed the board, `simulation` function, docstrings, gathered all the code into `CMSE_202_Final_Project_Health_2.ipynb`, organized files, background and motivation
